Roomer is an app that helps you find your perfect roommate. You can easily browse among all the room adverts and mark your favourites, and when you find that perfect room you can contact the user who posted the advert immediately. On the other hand, if you are looking for a roommate for your current appartment, you can post an advert an with a few simple steps and wait for your perfect roommate to contact you!
